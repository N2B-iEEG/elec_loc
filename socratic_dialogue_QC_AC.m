% Hi, I logged in and fixed seafile
% You just need to sync the library (as instructed in the SOP readme file)
% to a local folder and you can simply copy data into that folder
% When the computer is on, it auto-syncs like OneDrive.

% Now just wait for seafile to finish syncing (could take a day...)
% But hopefully no longer requiring manual retry
% ATfter that you can just copy files into seafile/Qian data transfer/

%Great!
%Is that the directory where we are supposed to save the data in this
%computer?

% (Qian) yes and no. Since we now have seafile, I don't see a reason
% to keep data in the original folder (I just cleaned it up a bit to save
% space).
 
%(Andre) Ok, so save in that folder, wait for you to download it, and then
%delete?

% (Q) Well, no need to delete either, bc as you delete it locally it gets
% deleted online too, just like onedrive. I will update the SOP to mention
% that when you copy data from nlx, you can directly copy into the transfer
% folder. That way you get a local copy on Romulus and I get a cloud copy.
% It's gonna take a while. I'm getting offline now. Say hi to everyone!
